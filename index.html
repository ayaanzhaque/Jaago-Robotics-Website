              in Bangladesh at the Jaago Foundation. We use the Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robotics kit to help

                We go once every year to teach Robotics and Coding to the bright
                students at the Jaago Schoool in Dhaka. We have gone twice so
                far, in the summer of 2018 and winter of 2019.

                  We aim to teach the fundamentals of Robotics and Coding to
                  students who have no exposure. We love teaching 
                  motivated and inspired students who want to have new
                  opportunites in often unaccessible fields, such as Computer
                  Science and Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By spreading robotics education and knowledge, the students will be
                  exposed to new fields, giving them new and promising career opportunities.

                  As each year progresses we improve our curriculum so the

                  not only do we continue to work with previous students, we
                  work with a new batch of students to extend our reach.

                    In between our first and second group of students, the first
                    group gave a presentation to Levi's, the denim company, in
                    the hopes of receiving funding for their school. The

                    For the final project, the students learned to code and
                    implement a line follower robot, which followed a black
                    line. Students used their new-found coding and engineering
                    skills to create their robot. After lots of testing, all
                    groups were able to achieve the task.

                    presentation to the JAAGO Board explaining the work they
                    have done in the past two weeks, and why it matters. This
                    was a huge success as the students were able to do this

                    Even though our in-person sessions are limited, the students
                    wanted to continue to learn new concepts. Therefore, with
                    the help of faculity, we were able to establish weekly
                    meetings where we would send lesson plans and long term
                    projects. The next project they began was a color sorting
                    robot.

                  I loved the robotics class because it changed my mind to shine
                  in a new way. I learned to think creatively and to imagine
                  things a new way. I learned about how machines work and
                  learned how to build and code them.

                  It's a platform from which we learn a lot of things. Before
                  this class we didn't know anything about robotics or coding,
                  so the sessions are really helpful and fun. This class was
                  very much helpful and interesting for us, and we enjoyed a lot
                  and learned a lot of great things.

                  Lego robotics was the most outstanding project at Jaago. As most of the
                  students and their family live below the property line, they never thought to learn something enriching.
                  Even as Teacher I was excited like all other students. By far Jaago lego robotics is the only
                  educational institute in Bangladesh who are helping the underprivileged students to learn robotics.
                  Ayaan and Shafin were really passionate about their work. I learned so many thing things from them, and by the end of their 1st visit,
                  around 20 of our students have already learned the basics and can do few programs of their own. Even we show cased
                  our lego robotics to the visitors, sponsor and govt. officials of education ministry.
                  The students surprised us with their ability of learning and findings solutions.
                  I'm truly grateful and hoping that we will learn new things through robotics and achieve more in near future.
