# [Jaago Robotics](https://jaagorobotics.tech/)

Partnered with the [Jaago Foundation](https://jaago.com.bd/) to teach robotics and coding to the brightest students in Bangladesh. We teach Robotics, Coding, and STEM to underpriveledged students in Bangladesh at the Jaago Foundation. As a branch of the Jaago Foundation, we use the Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robotics kit to help young students learn introductory robotics concepts. We want to provide new opportunities for students who don't have access to them. We go once every year to teach Robotics and Coding to the bright students at the Jaago Schoool in Dhaka. We have gone twice so far, in the summer of 2018 and winter of 2019.
